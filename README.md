### 1.3 📂 Extract Sysmon

- After the download, navigate to your **Downloads** folder.
- Right-click the Sysmon ZIP file and select **Extract All**. This will create a folder containing the Sysmon executable files.

### 1.4 📝 Download the Sysmon Configuration File

We’ll use a popular **Sysmon Olaf Configuration** from GitHub to define the activities Sysmon should log.

- Search for **Sysmon Olaf Configuration GitHub**.
- Visit the repository, scroll to find `sysmonconfig.xml`.
- Click **Raw** to view the XML content, right-click, and choose **Save As**. Save this file in the same folder where you extracted Sysmon.
