## How to Install Sysmon on a Windows Server and Confirm Telemetry

Sysmon (System Monitor) is a powerful tool that provides detailed information about system activity and helps in monitoring and analyzing system events. It is widely used by system administrators and cybersecurity professionals to gain visibility into suspicious activities, detect malware, and enhance system security.

In this guide, I will walk you through the process of installing Sysmon on a Windows Server, configuring it with a popular configuration file, and verifying that it is capturing telemetry. Let’s get started!

## Step 1: Download Sysmon and the Configuration File

To begin, you need to connect to your Windows Server via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and download Sysmon.

### 1.1 Connect to Your Windows Server

- Use your Host RDP client to connect to the Windows Server where you want to install Sysmon. Once connected, proceed with the following steps.

### 1.2 Download Sysmon

- Open Microsoft Edge or any web browser available on your Windows Server.
- Type “Sysmon download” in the search bar and navigate to the official [Microsoft Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) website.
- Download the latest version of Sysmon from the website. This will typically be a ZIP file containing Sysmon executables.

### 1.3 Extract Sysmon

- Once the download is complete, navigate to your **Downloads** folder.
- Right-click on the downloaded Sysmon ZIP file and select **Extract All**. This will create a new folder containing the Sysmon executable files.

### 1.4 Download the Sysmon Configuration File

To make Sysmon useful, we need a configuration file that tells it what activities to log. A well-known configuration is the **Sysmon Olaf Configuration** available on GitHub.

- Open your browser again and search for **Sysmon Olaf Configuration GitHub**.
- Go to the GitHub repository and scroll down to find `sysmonconfig.xml`.
- Click on the file and select **Raw** to view the raw XML content.
- Right-click on the page, choose **Save As**, and save the `sysmonconfig.xml` file in the same folder where you extracted Sysmon.

## Step 2: Install Sysmon

Now that we have Sysmon and the configuration file ready, it’s time to install Sysmon on the server.

### 2.1 Open PowerShell as Administrator

- Click on the Start Menu and search for **PowerShell**.
- Right-click on **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.

### 2.2 Navigate to the Sysmon Directory

- In the PowerShell window, use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you extracted Sysmon. For example:

    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads\Sysmon
    ```

- Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual username or the path where Sysmon is extracted.

### 2.3 Install Sysmon with the Configuration File

- Run the following command to install Sysmon with the `sysmonconfig.xml` configuration file:

    ```bash
    .\Sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
    ```

- If you are prompted to agree to the Sysinternals License Terms, click **Agree**.

Once this is complete, Sysmon will be installed and running on your server with the specified configuration.

### Successfully Installed Sysmon

## Step 3: Confirm Telemetry in Event Viewer

To ensure that Sysmon is capturing and logging telemetry correctly, you can check the logs in the Event Viewer.

### 3.1 Open Event Viewer

- Click on the Start Menu and search for **Event Viewer**.
- Open the Event Viewer application.

### 3.2 Navigate to Sysmon Logs

- In the left pane of the Event Viewer, navigate to **Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows**.
- Scroll down and look for **Sysmon**.
- Click on **Operational** under the Sysmon folder.
- You should now see a stream of logs generated by Sysmon. These logs will provide detailed information on system activity, such as process creation, network connections, and file modifications.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Sysmon on your Windows Server, configured it using a popular Sysmon configuration file, and confirmed that it is logging telemetry in the Event Viewer. 

With Sysmon in place, you now have a powerful tool to monitor your server for suspicious activity and enhance your security posture. 

Remember to keep your Sysmon configuration file up to date and adjust it according to your monitoring needs. **Happy monitoring!**
